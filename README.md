# Strata
Final Project for CS 229 by Jacob Thompson and Christy Jestin

# Running the Demo
Click on "visualization.py" in the goofy folder to run the demo. 
The player will be auto-attacking so that graders do not need to fiddle with controls; simply use W,A,S,D and r to move the player character and rotate it, respectively. Attempt to reduce the enemy health to 0 while preserving your own health! This represents a simple strategy by the adversary: maintain position and attack in circles as a defense.
